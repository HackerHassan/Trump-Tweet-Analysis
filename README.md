# Trump-Tweet-Analysis
Worked with Twitter data using Tweepy.org in order to analyze Donald Trump's tweets.

## What I learned from this project:
- Using sentiment analysis, I found that Trump favors Fox News and has a negative tone in regards to NY times.
- How to conduct robust sentiment analysis
- Conducted Tweet Source Analysis in order to see which devices Trump used to Tweet
  - iPhone
  - Android

## Understanding Sentiment Analysis:
We can use the words in Trump's tweets to calculate a measure of the sentiment of the tweet. For example, the sentence "I love America!" has positive sentiment, whereas the sentence "I hate taxes!" has a negative sentiment. In addition, some words have stronger positive / negative sentiment than others: "I love America." is more positive than "I like America."
